/**
 * Concrete subclass of <code>MessageResources</code> that reads message keys
 * and corresponding strings from named property resources in the same manner
 * that java.util.PropertyResourceBundle does. The
 * base property defines the base property resource name, and
 * must be specified.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTE - This class trades memory for
 * speed by caching all messages located via generalizing the Locale under
 * the original locale as well.
 * This results in specific messages being stored in the message cache
 * more than once, but improves response time on subsequent requests for
 * the same locale + key combination.
 *
 * This class is based on the struts class org.apache.struts.util.PropertyMessageResources
 * It loads the properties file using File I/O. This allows us to view the changes to the file, without having to reload the webapp.
 * It supports the flushing of the message-resource cache.
 * It also overrides the localeKey() method, to append the variation for the authenticated user to the toString() output of the Locale object.
